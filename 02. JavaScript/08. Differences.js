/* 08. diff b/w map and forEach
   - map returns new array but forEach does not return anaything
   - map didnot modifiy original array but forEach modified original array
   - we can chain stuff on map

09. null vs undefine
    null is an actual value but undefine indicate that veriable is declear but not intilize

10. undefine vs not define
   if we declare varible but not intilize it the value will be undefine
   if we didnot declare variable itself the we will get not defined

11. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
   Both are comparison operators. The difference between both the operators is that “==” is used to compare values whereas, “ === “ is used to compare both values and types.

12.
   Map, Filter, and Reduce are Array methods which help to create new arrays in various ways. They are all 'higher order' functions because they take user-defined functions as parameters.

   Map: returns an array of pieces of information from the original array. In the callback function, return the data you wish to be part of the new array.

   Filter: returns a subset of the original array based on custom criteria. In your callback function, return a boolean value to determine whether or not each item will be included in the new array.

   Reduce: can be used to return almost anything. It is often used to return a single number, like an sum, but it can also be used to combine the logic of Map and Filter to return an array of values matching certain criteria. This can remove unnecessary iterations.
